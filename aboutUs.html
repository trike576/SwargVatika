                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    SwargVatika was born from a simple vision: to bring the freshest, most nutritious farm produce 
                    directly from our fields to your family's table. Located in the heart of Jalgaon, Maharashtra, 
                    our farm has been cultivating the land for generations, carrying forward traditional farming 
                    wisdom while embracing modern, sustainable practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What started as a small family farm has grown into a trusted source of organic fruits, vegetables, 
                    dairy products, and more for our local community. We believe that everyone deserves access to food 
                    that is not only fresh and delicious but also grown with care, integrity, and respect for nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, SwargVatika stands as a testament to our commitment to quality, sustainability, and the 
                    well-being of our customers. Every product that leaves our farm carries with it the promise of 
                    freshness, nutrition, and the love we put into growing it.
